# nnUNet_v1_StatsLab  

This repository serves as a dedicated framework for dataset preparation, statistical analysis, and performance evaluation in nnU-Net v1 based biomedical image segmentation. It streamlines the process of dataset creation, preprocessing, and performance metric calculation, while also facilitating advanced statistical analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details  

The dataset used in this repository is stored in **`.mat` format** under the **`data`** folder. It includes:  
- **Table24h**: Contains both **control** and **therapy** data, systematically organized for analysis.  

This structured dataset is essential for training GMM and can also be used further for evaluating the nnU-Net v1 segmentation pipeline.

The .mat files are used to train the GMM model, whereas NIfTI files are utilized for training nnU-Net.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features  

- **Dataset Preparation**: Generates dataset JSON files following the nnU-Net v1 data structure, ensuring seamless integration with the pipeline.  
- **Data Processing**: Performs preprocessing and organizes the dataset for training and testing using the [nnU-Net v1 framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) (*branch: nnunetv1*).  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Computes segmentation performance metrics such as Dice, Tversky score, and additional quantitative measures.  
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualization**: Supports further statistical insights through Joint Probability Mapping (JPM), advanced plots, and figures for research publications.
